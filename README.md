# Assignment #1 Graphs

# In this assignment, we're going to write a Python program based on graphs to understand how they work because we need to implement Erdos-Renyi graphs. 
# We'll use both NetworkX and matplotlib to generate graphs, store those in a file, read graphs from a file, compute all shortest paths from a specified node using graph algorithms and visualize them by using shortest paths. 


# This is the command to excute the graph.py file located in the current directory, because it either reads the file graph_file.gml or creates a random graph. 
# We need to know that the graph_file.gml or the created graph is the graph used for analysis because the format is Graph Modeling Language (GML) which desribes the graph's structure based on attributes. 
# The program should read the attributes of both the nodes and edges in a file.
